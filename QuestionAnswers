#Question 1 - 
how do you trace requests which are coming from external party to experience and then pased to process api. without much changes on mule api's or external vendor api.

Answer - 
You want to trace the messages flowing through your Mule 4 application using a single unique Id. In many cases, you intend to trace the messages across Multiple applications 
which can be traced in application logs using an unique Id. How to achieve this?

By design, Correlation Ids cannot be changed within a flow in Mule 4 applications and can be set only at source. This ID is part of the Event Context and is generated 
as soon as the message is received by the application. When a HTTP Request is received, the request is inspected for "X-Correlation-Id" header.
a. If "X-Correlation-Id" header is present, HTTP connector uses this as the Correlation Id.  
b. If "X-Correlation-Id" header is NOT present, a Correlation Id is randomly generated.
Option a will work in this given scenario where Third pary has to generate and pass correlation Id to Mule experience api in HTTP header field as X-Correlation-Id

#Question 2 -
Consider we have two batch jobs and are processsing records, how many threads will be used batch job process and how records will be processed in batch job instance and within two batch jobs?

Answer - 
ref Link https://docs.mulesoft.com/mule-runtime/4.3/batch-processing-concept
Batch job uses several thread as per Mule autotuning capability it allocate thread to process those records. Also keep this in mind,
a batch job instance does not wait for all its queued records to finish processing in one batch step before pushing any of them to the next batch step.
that means batch job process records parallely, and assing several threads as per auto tune capability and process them in parallel within and in between two batch steps.

#Question 3 -
We need a sync fuctionality between salesforce and backend system. Sync fucntionality is achieved using watermark on account modified field. 
what stratergy will be used to store watermark? vm, anypoint mq, jms, or database, cache scope, redis cache or active mq

Answer - Persistent object store should be used to hold watermark so in case even application is restarted watermark will not be lost and sync functionality will resumne.

#Question 4 - 
Mule flow is writing data to two difference database in a single transaction, proposed new solution is to split this single transaction into two non-XA transaction,
what will be impacted due to this solution? Response time, consistency, performance, availability, throughput
Anwer - Consistency as both transactions are non-XA transaction due to which any db write failure will not impact other transaction write operation. 

#Question 5 -
An API needs to be accessed by client or testing team, API is enforced with ClientId enforcement policy. what should client or testing team should do to access this api
a.get clientid/secret from developer
b.get api owner access on api
c. request access to api instance and obtain client id/secret from exchange api portal
Answer - option C where any user/client can look into portal for api details and raise a request to get client id/secret to access that api.

#Question 6 -
Mule application A and B are using persistent object store for cache purpose, while A application is deployed to customer hosted runtime and B application is deployed to cloudhub.
Persistent object store is used from anypoint object store, how does application A and B will access data from Anypoint Object store?
a. both implement rest api to access data
b. both use object store connector to access data from anypoint object store
c. A uses rest api to access data while B application uses object store component
d. vice versa of option c

Answer - Option c As A application is deployed on customer hosted runtime so to access anypoint object store it will need rest api to access data while B application already deployed on
cloudhub so it can easily use object store connector to access this data.

#Question 14 -
CIDR block calculation- consider a scenario where we have 50 applications which are deployed with 2 clouhub worker and we have 3(dev,sit,uat) env per AWS AZ(2 AZ are allocated ) in a non-prod vpc,
calculate IP range  which wil be needed for this non-prod vpc
Answer - Mule applications are deployed in CloudHub workers and each worker is assigned with a dedicated IP .
Each application has 2 cloudhub worker which impact IP allocation as each cloudhub worker wil have seperate IP. 
so 1 application = 2 IP  --> 50 *2 = 100 /AZ1  = 200/Non-prod VPC  = 200*3(env) -> 600 IP address will needed in this Non-prod vpc + Additional IP for zero downtime deployment(50%) =300
Total 900 IP address needed.
which means 0.0.0.0/23(1024 IPS) CIDR cacluation will be needed here.  Keep below table in mind
	              Env Production VPC 	Non-production VPC
Dev		                              	 50
Staging		                         	 50
Performance		                      	 50 * 2 = 100
Production	    	 50 * 2 = 100	
Total 	                  	100	         200
Additional IP for zero 
downtime deployment(50%)	50	        100
Total IPS               	150	        300

Answer - ?? anypoint design center to desing raml and share for collaboration and feedback


#Question 31-
A Mule application is deployed to a cluster of two customer-hosted Mule runtimes. The Mule application has a flow that polls a database and another flow with an HTTP Listener.
HTTP clients send HTTP requests directly to individual cluster nodes.
What happens to database polling and HTTP request handling in the time after the primary (master) node of the cluster has failed, but before that node is restarted?
Answer - database polling will continue while http request will handle be handle on second node if second node is called directly???look into cluster documentation

#Question 32 -
Additional nodes are being added to an existing customer-hosted Mule runtime cluster to improve performance. Mule application deployed to this cluster are invoked by API client through a load balancer.
What is also required to carry out those change?
Answer - external aggregator or monitoring tool needs to be configured to recognise this new node

#Qustion 33 -
A Mule application is deployed to a multi-node Mule runtime cluster. The Mule application use the competing consumer pattern among its cluster replicas to receive JMS messages from a JMS queue. To Process each received JMS message, the following steps are performed 4in a flow: 
Step1: The JMS correlation ID header is read from the received JMS message. 
Step2: The Mule application invokes an idempotent SOAP webservice over HTTPS, Passing the JMS Correlation ID as one parameter in the SOAP request. 
Step 3: The response from the SOAP webservice also return the same JMS CORRELATION id. 
Step4: The JMS correlation ID received from the SOAP webservice is validated to be identical to the JMS Correlation ID in Step1. 
Step5: The mule application creates a response JMS message setting the JMS Correlation ID message header to the validated JMS correlation ID and publishes that message to a response JMS queue.

Anwser - Shoul it be store in variable or persistent object or non-persisten object store ? think about multi node cluster and jms part.
